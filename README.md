# Job Title Classification - GUI
### Features:
- User friendly GUI for Training Model and Getting Predictions
- 3 Models can be trained and best can be chosen
- After training model - Accuracy and F1 score is displayed
- User can chose the model and test split %
- "Try out the model" gives access to realtime predictions - gains user trust

### Tech stack:
Framework: Django
Backend: Python Django
Database: SQL lite

## Future Enhancements:
- The final output may present probabilities for all classes, not just the one with the highest likelihood.
- Users can specify the probability threshold for predictions.
- Post training, users can utilize varied metrics to assess the model and view the confusion matrix.
- Users have the ability to adjust the hyperparameters of their selected model.
